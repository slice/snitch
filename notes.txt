scrape some kind of "base" to determine if we need the details
evaluates to a minimal set of information that we can compare to know if we need the details

- for frontend: get the landing page, use `x-build-id` header
  https://<branch>.discord.com/app
- for hosts:
  - for windows: use courgette
  https://updates.discord.com/distributions/app/manifests/latest?channel=<branch>&platform=win&arch=x86
  - for mac, linux: use host endpoints
  https://discordapp.com/api/updates/<branch>?platform={osx,linux}

don't bother fetching the build number if the build id is the same

if the "base" has changed from the previous, then scrape the details

- for frontend:
  download entrypoint script and find the build information
  should have regexes for both swc and pre-swc
- for hosts: parse the json appropriately

store the details, and post to a webhook/notify api consumers/websocket
